Both science and art explore the complex realities of life by reducing difficult problems to something tangible, to be studied or explored. The mission of this collaboration was to highlight the similar goals of both subjects, which are often thought of as antagonists. Reductions are multimedia interactive sculptures that challenge the viewer to consider how art and science can cohesively represent and inform a singular phenomenon. The viewer is encouraged to touch and engage with both the art and science presented. Reductions responds to not only a need for greater collaboration within university spaces, but also the need for collaboration in creating solutions to pressing environmental, political, and social issues of the current moment. This project was advised by an interdisciplinary group of faculty from arts and sciences, and carried out by students from both fine arts and science.
