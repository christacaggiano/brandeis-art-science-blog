One our final tasks as a group was deciding on a presentation mechanism. We chose
to showcase the artistic and scientific process, as the messy process of creation is one of the strongest
similarities between the two disciplines. We used large newspaper prints that
enlarged the final notebook plans. Wall text was kept simple, with brief starting
and ending text that summarized our inspiration and the science behind our sculpture.
We used a powerpoint to mock up our display, as it was flexible and allowed us to
explore a variety of ways of presenting our data.

Excerpts from this powerpoint are here:
