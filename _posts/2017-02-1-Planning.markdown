The physicist tool of choice is the whiteboard. For many artists, they start with a sketch.
It was interesting to combine methodologies into whiteboard sketching, which became the foundation
for our planning.

Since the Fraden lab's research hinges on oscillation, we naturally gravitated towards
organic forms that naturally undulate. The obvious choice was an eel. Eels move in
a slither, and can glide through the water by manipulating their bodies in a wave form.
The whipping motion is reminiscent of the coupled dynamics of the BZ reaction. Even more
specifically, it mimics neuronal firing, where an action potential can be transmitted
in oscillations of activation and inhibition.

Besides the natural world, we found oscillation in a much easier context: physics.
In particular, we were compelled by the light component of the Fraden lab CPGs. Light is
a beautiful, and often interactive, way to communicate. We realized how important it was
to us that our sculpture easily engages with a viewer. All good art should be stimulating,
but we wanted our viewers to connect with two seemingly disconnected disciplines. We thought
about allowing the viewers of our sculpture to tinker with small LED displays coordinated
by an Arduino computer. This would allow them to experience our ideas in a deeper way.

Our final inspiration came from monumental minimalist sculpture. Minimalism resonated with
us particularly because, as an artistic movement, minimalism tries to communicate large
ideas with efficiency and directness. In many ways, science strives to do this as well.
Another really fun part about minimalist sculpture is how the viewer interacts with it in
space. Much like science, you need to approach it from many angles or perspectives and perhaps,
many times, for it to reveal its true meaning.

Our interest in this sort of sculpture lead us to the MIT museum, where we sought more
inspiration.
