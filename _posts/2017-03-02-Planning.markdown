One month out from the festival, we met once more in the art building in order to
finalize our plans. Our main concerns at this point were vision - while we had
a diverse range of ideas and materials, we wanted to specifically ask ourselves

a) what are we communicating to our audience/what problem are we trying to solve

b) what are we doing that is different?

We sketched the beginnings of our final product and began to divide up tasks in
order to actually build.
