The MIT museum is sort of a sleeping gem in Kendall Square. It isn't quite
a science museum or an art museum; instead it is firmly a science as art museum,
displaying vestiges of scientific progress with the gusto previously reserved
for Renaissance masters.

As a result of this mission, the MIT museum has an extremely rich collection of
interactive sculpture. Particularly, they have a deep permanent collection
featuring the work of Arthur Ganson. Ganson is a kinetic sculptor. His work is beautiful
and often existential, but above all, has al the hallmarks of a mechanical engineer.
Referred as "Gestural Engineering" by the museum curator, all his sculptures make some
sort of mechanical gesture in space: they rotate, shrug, or even dance.

The most immediate appeal of these gestural sculptures is how they compel the viewer to interact 
with them.

This was signficant to our intiative because it really the viewer to engage with 
the science being presented, as well as considering the sculpture as an aesthetic object. 
Ganson's sculptures use gears, metal, motors, and often unusual components that results 
in an almost baffling contraption that invites the onlooker to think deeply about how it 
was made. A combination like this is exactly what we were hoping to achieve in our piece.
