Planning naturally moved fron the theoretical to the hands-on. This also marked the 
transition from Abelson, the physics building, to Goldman Schwartz, the art studio as the space for meetings. 
This was an acknowledgement of practicality- Goldman Schwartz had the necessary materials- but also 
of a sort of restlessness that both scientists and artists feel after a while. Artists and scientists 
are both, at their roots, experimenters.
