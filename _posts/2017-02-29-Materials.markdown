A shared element of art and science is that in order to innovate, you need to make the unimaginable possible.
This manifested for us in this project with our choice of materials. What we were planning based on our preliminary
sculpting required large scale woodworking and casting in a flexible material. None of us had experience in the
artistic and physical skills that this required. Even the creation of this website required an expansion of our skillsets.

We chose Reynold's Advanced Materials, in Brighton, MA to procure our casting supplies. Reynold's was a menagerie of
interesting chemicals. It was a cross between a laboratory and an art studio. Here we bought a variety of supplies for
a flexible cast of an eel, including Dragon Skin High Performance Silicon Rubber for our cast.

A completely wild addition to our artistic process was buying and transporting an eel. We bought it from the North End fish market
(already deceased) and came armed with styrofoam buckets of ice. The actual eel form was central to this process. It cemented our
inspiration and set the foundation for the rest of the project.
